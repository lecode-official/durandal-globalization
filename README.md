# Durandal Globalization

A simple globalization library written in TypeScript for Durandal. It supports numerical, date, and time processing based on different cultures. This library is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
